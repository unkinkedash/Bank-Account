# Bank-Account
My first useful project with simple task
Stores the data in two different .txt files. If the user does not have a account, the program creates one with the name and the amout of money.
This one was the first one I've done after my first semester at computer science programming course. Only basic commands, and instead of bunary files, I used .txt files.
